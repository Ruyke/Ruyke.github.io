            <p>
                Honda vehicles with automatic transmission require proper maintenance and calibration, especially Japanese hybrids such as Fit, Vezel, Shuttle, and so on that are rarely serviced by Irish dealerships.
                The detailed procedure is described below.

            <p>
                Vehicles imported from Japan may retain their original equipment manufacturer (OEM) settings (software), including crucial modules like the engine ECU and transmission computing unit. 
                It is important to note that due to past recall campaigns in Japan, these vehicles might not have received the necessary manufacturer updates. 
                This could potentially impact performance and lead to issues. Consider upgrading to ensure your vehicle runs smoothly and avoids potential damage.
                The detailed procedure is described below.

            <h3>Spare Key Writing Service</h3>
            <p>
                Many Japanese imports come to Ireland with only one key.
                At first, it could feel unnecessary to trouble ourselves with a spare one. 
                However, what if the only key gets lost or damaged somehow? 
                In this case, it could be extremely difficult to recover access to the car since the only means to interact with the immobilizer is via the original key.
                So, all in all, it surely feels safer to have a spare key.</p>

        <h3>Honda Transmission Calibration Description:</h3>
         <p>
            It is recommended to calibrate your transmission at least once a year, especially if your Honda has a dual-clutch transmission DCT (Honda Fit Hybrid, Vesel, etc.). 
            It’s even better to combine it with an annual clutch fluid DOT4 change. 
         </p>
         <p> 
            The procedure allows your transmission to understand the clutch disk wear and adjust accordingly, which results in adequate shifting and performance overall, thereby making your car transmission last longer.
            The procedure lasts about 30-40 minutes, and it also requires some relatively empty and straight piece of road about 50 – 100m long for shift learning.
         </p>
        
        <br>
        <h3>Honda Software Update Description:</h3>
        <p>
            The software updates is used for various car modules / units like the ECU, Gearbox, IMA 
            (for hybrids), Power Steering, i-shift, etc. The update depends largely depends on your 
            car’s year, model and the spec level, as well as when it was last updated in Japan. This 
            procedure is also required when the notorious trouble code Р1737 appears. 
         </p>
         <p>   
            The overall result of those updates is performance and smoothness 
            improvement. The first guess of the available updates will depend on your car 
            chassis number (e.g. GP5-0000000), but the most accurate understanding will 
            come after a proper scan procedure of all systems with a special scan tool.
            After an initial scan is done, which could be combined with a calibration procedure, this 
            information can be then used to search for the most recent software available for your 
            particular car.
         </p>
         <p> 
            Once the software is found and acquired, Some preparation should be 
            arranged before the update, mostly there should be access to a 230 V power receptacle to 
            charge the car battery during the process. This is because it’s quite a delicate matter and 
            you do not want your battery to drain during flashing.
         </p>
         <p>            
            This procedure lasts about 1 - 2 hours, depending on the preparation 
            circumstances.

         <h3>Honda Spare Key Writing Description:</h3>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="img/sparekeys.jpg"  alt="keys pic">
        </div>
 
        <p> 
        Currently there are key types only for Honda Fit Hybrid models (GP5, GP6) in stock. If you look at your chassis number (VIN), it should say something like GP5-0000000 (the real number instead of “0”).
         </p>
         <p>    
        If your car VIN is from a different model GK, GH, etc., but the key looks identical, I can make an attempt to add this key to your car, it could work. Technically they should also work for Vezel (RU1, RU2, RU3, RU4) from 12.2013 until 01.2018 years., Shuttle (GP7, GP8, GK8, GK9).
         </p>
         <p>    
        This is a genuine product; it is not an aftermarket clone. I have tried a few clones from well-known markets, and the car would not recognize or see the key. Therefore, the only reasonable option is to resort to genuine Japanese products.
         </p>
         <p>    
        If you have other Honda car models like Grace, Insight, and you would like to have a spare key, please, let me know and we can work something out.
